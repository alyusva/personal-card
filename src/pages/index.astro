	  aboutMe={`Hi there! I'm Alvaro, an engineer specialized in <strong>industrial automation</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, and <strong>data analysis</strong>.

With experience in companies like Signify and Antolin, I have led projects that combine technology, efficiency, and future vision â€” from AGV systems and computer vision to machine learning models applied to the improvement of industrial processes.

I have also developed my own products in the field of NLP and emotional intelligence, and I have a strong interest in innovation with real-world impact.

My goal: to connect the physical world with the digital one to transform industries, processes, and experiences.  
Let's collaborate TOGETHER!
